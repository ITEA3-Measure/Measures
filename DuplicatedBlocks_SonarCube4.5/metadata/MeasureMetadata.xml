    <description>Number of duplicated blocks of lines.

For a block of code to be considered as duplicated:

    Non-Java projects:
        There should be at least 100 successive and duplicated tokens.
        Those tokens should be spread at least on:
            30 lines of code for COBOL
            20 lines of code for ABAP
            10 lines of code for other languages

    Java projects:
        There should be at least 10 successive and duplicated statements whatever the number of tokens and lines.

Differences in indentation as well as in string literals are ignored while detecting duplications.</description>
